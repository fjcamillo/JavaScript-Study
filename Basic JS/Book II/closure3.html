  /*
  Creates a different output everytime, we are taking advantage of the property of let
  1. let casts the variable name everytime the for loop was fired, so in this example the for loop fired six times, chaging
  the value of i from 0 - 5, with every value casted individually

  The output for this function is
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
